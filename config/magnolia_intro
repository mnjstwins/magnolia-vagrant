The easiest way to start with Magnolia CMS is to use the quickstart project located under /magnolia/projects/quickstart-project.

If you want to create a new project, please use our maven archetype executing this command from the directory /magnolia/projects:

   $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/content/groups/public/

The wizard will ask you some questions to automatically configure your project.

See the official documentation for more details: https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Creating+a+custom+bundle

Now that you have a Magnolia CMS project, you can use the following commands from the project directory:
 -  to build the project: mvn clean install
 -  to start Magnolia CMS: docker-compose up <instance_name>
 -  to stop Magnolia CMS: docker-compose stop
 
The project can be opened from any IDE on your laptop: 
     1. Checkout and modify the code locally
     2. Use vagrant rsync or rsync-auto to syncrhonise your laptop and VM. 
     3. Build and start the container from the VM
     3. Debug the instance from your IDE using remote debug (hotswap available)

If you want to use EE moduels, please run this script from your project to automatically set your Nexus credentials.

   $ /magnolia/scripts/useEE.sh
